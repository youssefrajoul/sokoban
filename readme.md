# Sokoban Web App Game

## Description

This is a simple Sokoban web game developed during the first year of my bachelor's degree. The game challenges players to move boxes to designated locations within a grid-based map. It is built using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Features

- Classic **Sokoban** gameplay where player push boxes to the target spots.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Simple, intuitive interface.

## Development Tools

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefrajoul/sokoban.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd sokoban
   ```

3. **Open the application in your browser:**

   - If you are using a live server extension or a local development server, use the following URL:

   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:your-port-number/index.html
   ```

   - Replace your-port-number with the port your server is running on (e.g., 5500, 3000, etc.).

   - Alternatively, you can open the index.html file directly in your web browser by navigating to the file location on your computer.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to move the player and push the boxes.
- Solve the puzzle by moving all the boxes to their target locations.
- The game is static and does not require any backend or database setup.
